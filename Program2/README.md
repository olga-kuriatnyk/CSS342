#### Program 2: Recursion

**Purpose:**

The programming assignment will provide an exercise in using recursion. There are two
problems which need to be solved. The first asks for a recursive function to calculate the
Catalan number. This problem will also require the student to utilize command line arguments
for their program. The second exercise is a path-finding problem in two-dimensional space.
The second problem will require the student to have good overall factoring and class design.
This will be a part of the final grade.
This assignment will also require the student to use Linux to build and run their applications as
we will test these programs solely on the Linux Lab systems.
